            My name is Alix, I’m 30 years old. I have been practicing Sao-Lim for nearly 9 years, first in Bayonne (FR) with Pascal Boby then in Geneva (CH) with Dominique Falquet. I also did some Newaza (judo on the floor). I particularly appreciate sustained physical efforts.<br/><br/><br/>
            The Sao-Lim came into my life at an important time when I needed to find a structuring and deep activity that required efforts. I was able to find everything I was looking for in this discipline. It takes (a lot of) perseverance and endurance. It allowed me to step back on many things and channel my energy.<br/><br/><br/>
            After these 8 years of Sao-Lim, I chose to move to Sweden. I tried other styles here in Göteborg but I couldn’t find another discipline that had everything I was looking for. So I decided I wanted to share my teaching.
