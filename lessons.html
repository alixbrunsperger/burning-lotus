            <i>A course lasts 1h30, and adapts to all levels present. You must be at least 18 years old to be able to come and train</i><br/><br/>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Content of a lesson</h3>
            A class always starts with a body warm-up.<br/><br/>
            Then comes a basic training consisting of positions, movements and/or repeated moves per series. The basic part can be completed by hardenings which consist in hitting parts of the body against that of his partner in order to make them harder.<br/><br/>
            Then come the taos (forms), long sequences of blows and movements performed alone or in groups.<br/><br/>
            There is also a portion of the course reserved for two-man work and martial applications of movements. This part consists of attack/block exercises or grips.<br/><br/>
            A class always ends with a short meditation, sitting on the floor , eyes closed.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Equipments</h3>
            The training is done barefoot, with a simple white T-shirt and black martial arts pants. It can be useful to have a mouth guard for advanced contact exercises.<br/><br/>
            The room has mobile striking bags to train the blows.
