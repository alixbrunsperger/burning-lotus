            <br/>Let’s start with kung fu origin and some other information and then about Sao Lim more precisely.
            <h2 class="title">Traditional Kung fu</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">“gong fu “ word origin</h3>
            “Gong” means “mastery”, “improvement”, “possession of a trade” or an action in which much time has been devoted. Fu designates the techniques as content, that is, the energy that has been invested in the action of this technique. We can say that someone has gong fu in gastronomy, gong fu in painting etc…..

            <h3 class="subtitle">Shaolin</h3>
            The Shaolin quan style is generally considered the first institutionalized martial art. According to legend, Boddhidarma (no evidence) taught this martial art in the 5th century to the monks of the Shaolin Temple, to help them defend the monastery. The oldest evidence of Shaolin monks’ participation in fighting is a stele dating from 728. In the 16th and 17th centuries, sources appear that attest to the practice of martial arts by Shaolin monks as an integral part of monastic life.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Modern history and contemporary China</h3>
            During the Chinese Civil War period (1927-1950), Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public. Chinese martial arts began to expand internationally with the founding of the People’s Republic of China (1949). Many artists chose to escape communist rule and migrated to other parts of the world.11 The practice of traditional martial arts was discouraged during the turbulent years of the Cultural Revolution (1969-1976). During this period the modern wushu system was established, including standardized forms, educational programs, instructors and rankings. In the 1990s and as a result of these societal changes, both traditional and modern approaches to martial arts are now supported by the government as part of Chinese culture.

            <h2 class="title">Sao-Lim Hood Khar Pai</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Origin</h3>
            The Sao-Lim Hood Karpai is a traditional style from southern China and was taught to monks when they served as mercenaries or escorts. So it was created for real survival situations. This style has kept its martial authenticity and is not assimilated to a sport of combat or competition.<br/><br/>
            It seems that it was only practiced in monasteries until 1940, which would explain why it was not very widespread. On this date, a monk named Sik Koe Chum left the Hokkien to go to Indonesia, then Singapore, and finally Malaysia. It was in these three countries that he taught his art to non-monk students, including Master P’ng Chye Khym who became his successor on the island of Penang (Malaysia).

            <h3 class="subtitle">What it consists of</h3>
            As said above, it was taught for real situations and therefore had to be effective. This is why this style is defined by low positions and an optics oriented towards purified efficiency. The style is based on different exercises:<br/><br/>
            – Hardening: a strengthening and habituation of the forearms is necessary to avoid apprehension during blockages. These hardenings are also extended to the thighs and shins.<br/><br/>
            – Work with partner: “realistic” work exercises with two people are important to have a good spatial-temporal and structural feeling of an adversary potential.<br/><br/>
            – Taos : Forms are educational tools that help refine practice. Once the sequence is memorized, one can concentrate on more structural or internal details.<br/><br/>
            – Weapons: After a certain level of practice, weapons are taught which are an extension of hand-to-hand combat. The learning of a weapon allows the student to confront new constraints while reinforcing his training with bare hands.<br/><br/>
            – Animals: The style also includes different animal forms, which are in themselves for each a particular style. These particularities are only taught after very advanced learning.<br/><br/>
            – Meditation: Zhen or Ch’an meditation is an integral part of the style. The mental and spiritual Ch’an part of the Sao-Lim allows to work the necessary lucidity for the fight.<br/><br/>
            See a course description for more details.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Objectives and requirements</h3>
            The Sao-Lim allows to develop the body (flexibility, speed, strength, coordination…) as well as the mind (attention, reactivity, lucidity, taking a step back…).<br/><br/>
            This requires motivation and unfailing application. Efforts will be present at each class, both physically and mentally.
